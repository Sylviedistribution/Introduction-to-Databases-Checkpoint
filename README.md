README â€“ Presentation: Comparison Between SQL and NoSQL
ðŸ“– Context

This presentation was prepared as part of a checkpoint exercise on databases.
The goal is to compare SQL databases, which follow a relational model, with NoSQL databases, represented here by MongoDB.
The comparison aims to highlight their differences in structure, functionality, scalability, and use cases.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Define and present the main characteristics of SQL databases.

Define and present the main characteristics of NoSQL databases (focus on MongoDB).

Compare both approaches on key criteria (performance, scalability, flexibility, consistency, queries, use cases).

Provide recommendations on when to use SQL vs NoSQL depending on project requirements.

ðŸ“‚ Structure of the Presentation

Introduction â€“ General context and definitions.

SQL Databases â€“ Origin, characteristics, and examples.

NoSQL Databases (MongoDB) â€“ Origin, characteristics, and types.

Direct Comparison â€“ Table comparing SQL and NoSQL.

When to Use & Conclusion â€“ Practical recommendations and final insights.

ðŸ§­ Expected Outcome

By the end of the presentation, the audience should:

Understand the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases.

Identify contexts where SQL is the best fit.

Identify contexts where NoSQL is more appropriate.

Be aware that both technologies are complementary, not mutually exclusive.
